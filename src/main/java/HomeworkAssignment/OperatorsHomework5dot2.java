        1) given: int a = 100; int b = 200;
        write a program that will print the sum of two variables.

        2) given int q = 5; int w = 9, int e = 10;
        write a program that will print the sum of all three variables.

        3) using operators and variables, write a program that will print following lines of code:
        1 + 2 = 3
        3 - 1 = 2
        2 * 2 = 4
        4 / 2 = 2
        2 + 8 = 10
        10 % 7 = 3

        4) Length and width of a rectangle are 9 and 15 respectively. Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle. Print results as following:

        The area of a rectangle is:

        The perimeter of rectangle is:


        5) Write a program to add 8 to the number 2345 and then divide it by 3. Now, the modulus the total sum with 5 and then multiply the result value by 5. Print the final result as following:


        6) Now, solve the above question using compound operators (eg. +=, -=, *=).


        Write a program to check if the two numbers 23 and 45 are equal.



        8) Write a program to check if the two numbers -10 and 10 are equal.
